            <p>When I started making my website, I knew I wanted it to have a modern, clean and minimalistic appearance. In this section, I will explain the ways in which I have tried to attain my desired aesthetic.
First of all, in the interests of minimalism and simplicity, I knew that I needed to use colours in a way that wasn’t garish. The website needed to be easy on the eyes. I knew that using too many different colours would detract from the modern, simplistic look I have in mind. I was also aware that having too many colours could actually be a distraction from the site’s content itself. Lingscars.com is a well known example of a site that looks too complex and is challenging to navigate. It has even been described as the "worst website ever made" (Wheaton, 2015). Part of the reason for this is that too many colours were used.
To ensure my site was easy on the eyes, I used a black typeface on a white background in text-heavy sections.
</p>

<p>The fonts I have chosen are “Oswald” and “Roboto”. I have chosen these fonts because they are sans-serif, which means there aren’t any extended features on the end of the letters. Sans-serif fonts are often associated with modernity and minimalism. On the Canva website, it says "it is universally acknowledged that most contemporary designs require a versatile sans serif font" (Tiwari, n.d.).
I also ensured that my text isn’t too thin. The first font I used on my website, Montserrat, looked too thin for my liking so I changed it too "Roboto". In my opinion, Roboto looks much better. As I mentioned before, I used black text on a white background to make it easier to read. At the header image on top of each page, I used white text over the picture's dark, orange colour cast so there is enough contrast for the viewer to read the text easily.</p>

<p>As I was designing my website, I took various steps to ensure that my website is accessible to a wide range of people. First of all, in my photography section, I included alt-text with all of my images so that visually-impaired people can receive a narration about the images. I made sure my alt-text is limited to a couple of sentences to make it as concise as possible, whilst still describing the most important parts of the images to the user.
My use of dark text on a white background was also decided upon in the interest of accessibility for those with visual impairments. People with visual impairments often find high-contrast themes easier to look at (Witting, 2012). I have also made effort to write in concise, plain English. Writing in plain English reduces confusion and saves the time of the reader because they don't have to figure out what the text means (5 Reasons To Use Plain Language | Writers Write, 2012). For example, I wrote some explanations of my images on the Photography Portfolio page and did not mention anything technical that people who aren't interested in photography wouldn't understand.</p>

            <p>Analogous colours are colours that are positioned next to each other on the colour wheel (e.g red, orange and red-orange). Analogous colours are pleasing to our eyes and often appear in nature. In design, analogous colours can be incorporated to achieve a sense of serenity and balance. </p>
