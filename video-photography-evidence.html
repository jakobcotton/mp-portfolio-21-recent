            <p>As part of my photographic project, I decided to take pictures of a “Kill The Bill” protest in Manchester. I took these images on a Minolta X-700 with Superia 400 film and a 50mm f/2 lens. These are all very good “all-rounder” pieces of equipment. The film’s ISO of 400 allowed me to expose all parts of the scenes correctly and the 50mm lens was neither too short or too long.

</p>

I had the film processed at a lab and I carried out digital post-production in Photoshop. This mainly involved cropping, changing the amount of contrast and adjusting the exposure of certain areas within the images.
When I took the photos, I did not have any particular preference about the shutter speed or aperture so I used the camera’s auto-exposure mode to do this for me while I concentrated on taking well-composed shots in what was a fast-paced, unpredictable environment. If I concentrated too much on my exposure, I might've not had time to frame my shots well.
Overall, I really like these images. My favourite is the image of the female protestor talking to the crowd while the tram goes past. I like to use central framing a lot in my work because it can help convey immersion in the environment (Oseman, 2017).

 <p>For our video production project, my group made a short piece for MOTDx. The video is about people's opinions about the current state of Football. We wanted to talk to different footballers, joke around with them and give them an opportunity to show off their other talents. We shot in Moss Side and captured lots of interesting conversations with local people. The current standard aspect ratio for television is 16:9 (Demers and Babcock, 2019), so we shot in this aspect ratio with a JVC 4k camera for the best image quality we could attain. Inspired by YouTube channels such as "Link Up TV", we shot handheld to convey a sense of intensity. I was also aware that not using a tripod would probably help the interviewees to feel more at ease.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the footage that we captured turned out to be severely overexposed. The footage was recovered in DaVinci Resolve, the editing software we used. The footage was so overexposed that it was permanently damaged. The colours ended up looking sickly. The footage was also very noisy, partly due to the ISO being set too high.</p>
<p>Although it had some major quirks, I think the video is quite funny and an enjoyable watch. The editing software we used allowed us to create a watchable video out of poor-quality footage.</p>
<p>Alongside our broadcast version of the video, we needed to create a shorter version of the video to be used on social media. We chose to create one for Instagram in a square (1:1) aspect ratio. We chose this aspect ratio because this is the ratio that is often associated with Instagram. We included some of what we thought to be the best parts of our video, such as Mohammed the singer and a young rapper performing and doing backflips by the side of the street. The Instagram version features the Street Talk logo at the beginning and end so that social media users could recognise us.</p>
<p>Because the video was originally filmed in a 16:9 aspect ratio, we had difficulty fitting the shot of Damon talking to the bicycle-mounted footballer into a square. Although it was a tight squeeze, we managed to get them both in the shot and the framing only looks awkward for a few seconds. All of the other shots worked really well, with the subjects clearly visible in the frame. I think our Instagram video looks great.</p>
